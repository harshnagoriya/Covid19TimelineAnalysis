In this repository (project) I have

* Created a storyboard showing the spread of Covid 19 cases of my country India.
* Used animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story.
* Identified interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid 19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts.
